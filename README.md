# Vocalized-Arabic-Parallel-Dataset
This is a high-quality vocalized Arabic-English corpus that automatically creates an Arabic-English parallel corpus.

We used the UN dataset in Arabic and English, which is a free source of similar corpora. There are 584284 parallel sentences totaling more than 5 million words in the resulting vocalized Arabic-English corpus.


Three versions of the Arabic-English parallel corpus are available: vocalized, non-vocalized, and vocalized with tashkeel in the final chapter.
